##Purpose: 
The purpose of this page is to demonstrated my ability to create staic websites using basic HTML/CSS frameworks.

##Technology Used:
I used [Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) as the framework for the design.

##Updates:
This site will be updated as more works are created. I will normally link any and all works I would like to share on the page. Also, as I learn more about Web Development, this page will also be updated to reflect he Technologies used within the pages.
